# To start

1. npm install to download dependencies, this will auto install server and client packages
2. You'll need .env file with secrets, use env-example as sample, rename to .env, and use Heroku config var and copy values for local development, reach out to me for those.
3. npm start would start local dev mode, watching only FE at this point, you can run watch-be if needed
4. npm run prod would start prod mode, with build version of client
5. to build client use npm build
